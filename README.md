# bloodBankDonation
The main goal of the Blood Donation Database project is to help patients who are looking for fresh blood in a specific location. In this project, we store information about blood donors. Persons interested in donating blood to a patient must register with this project. The proposed project should save time, reduce manual labor, be convenient and easy to use.

DonorRepository: store data from database for getAllDonors and getAddnewDonor methods;
